# Command: analyze-email

## Purpose

Analyze an email document to extract key information, classify its importance, assign it to relevant projects, identify action items, and prepare a draft response. All analysis results are saved to a structured JSON file for downstream processing.

## Command Type

`analyze-email`

## Input

You will receive a request file containing:
- Email content (body, subject, sender, recipients)
- Email metadata (date, time, headers)
- RAG database connection details (for project assignment)
- User preferences (optional)

## Process

### Phase 1: Email Content Analysis

1. **Read Email Document**
   - Parse email subject, body, sender, recipients
   - Extract metadata (date, time, CC, BCC if available)
   - Identify attachments mentioned or referenced
   - Note email thread context if provided

2. **Extract Key Information**
   - Identify main topics and themes
   - Extract specific requests or questions
   - Note mentioned dates, deadlines, or time-sensitive information
   - Identify key stakeholders mentioned
   - Extract any reference numbers, project codes, or identifiers

### Phase 2: Classification

3. **Classify Email Importance**
   - Analyze content and metadata to classify as one of:
     - **unimportant**: Mass emails, newsletters, low-priority updates, spam-like content
     - **personal**: Personal correspondence, non-work related, social invitations
     - **professional**: Work-related, business correspondence, project updates, actionable items

   - Consider these factors:
     - Sender relationship (colleague, client, vendor, unknown)
     - Subject urgency indicators (urgent, ASAP, deadline, etc.)
     - Content type (FYI, action required, question, update)
     - Presence of deadlines or action items
     - Email thread importance

   - Provide classification confidence score (0.0-1.0)
   - Document classification reasoning in comments

### Phase 3: Project Assignment

4. **Query RAG Database**
   - Extract keywords and phrases from email content
   - Generate embedding or search query based on:
     - Email subject and body content
     - Mentioned project names or codes
     - Referenced documents or systems
     - Stakeholder names
     - Technical terms or domain-specific language

5. **Match to Project**
   - Query RAG database with extracted features
   - Retrieve top 3-5 project matches with similarity scores
   - Select best matching project based on:
     - Similarity score threshold (>0.7 recommended)
     - Content relevance
     - Stakeholder overlap
     - Recent project activity

   - If no good match found (all scores <0.5):
     - Set project_assignment.status to "unassigned"
     - Suggest creating new project or manual review
   - If multiple strong matches (scores >0.8):
     - Set status to "multiple_matches"
     - List all strong candidates for user review

   - Document matching process in comments

### Phase 4: Task Extraction

6. **Identify Action Items**
   - Scan email for explicit tasks:
     - Action verbs (review, approve, send, create, update, etc.)
     - Questions requiring responses
     - Requests for information or deliverables
     - Meeting requests or scheduling needs

   - For each identified task:
     - Extract task description
     - Determine task type (respond, review, create, schedule, research, etc.)
     - Identify task owner (you, sender, other party)
     - Extract related context and requirements

7. **Determine Urgency and Deadlines**
   - Analyze for urgency indicators:
     - **Critical**: Explicit urgent markers, imminent deadlines (<24 hours), blocking issues
     - **High**: Near-term deadlines (1-3 days), important stakeholders, escalations
     - **Medium**: Standard deadlines (4-7 days), routine requests, normal priority
     - **Low**: Long-term deadlines (>7 days), FYI items, optional tasks

   - Extract deadlines:
     - Explicit dates ("by Friday", "before March 15")
     - Implicit timeframes ("ASAP", "end of week", "Q1")
     - Recurring deadlines ("weekly report", "monthly update")

   - Convert to standardized format (ISO 8601)
   - If no deadline specified, suggest reasonable deadline based on urgency

### Phase 5: Draft Response

8. **Analyze Response Requirements**
   - Determine if response is needed
   - Identify key points to address
   - Note any questions to answer
   - Consider required tone (formal, casual, apologetic, etc.)
   - Identify if response requires attachments or follow-up actions

9. **Generate Draft Response**
   - Create draft email response including:
     - Appropriate greeting based on sender relationship
     - Address all questions and requests
     - Confirm understanding of tasks and deadlines
     - Propose next steps if applicable
     - Professional closing

   - Match tone to original email and relationship
   - Keep response concise and actionable
   - Include placeholders for information you don't have ([YOUR_INPUT_NEEDED])
   - Add suggested subject line (Re: or continuation)

   - If no response needed, set draft_response to null and explain why

### Phase 6: Save Structured Output

10. **Prepare JSON Output File**
    - Determine sequence number for email analysis
    - Check `orchestrator/email-analysis/` directory for existing analyses
    - Use next sequential number (0001, 0002, 0003, etc.)
    - If directory doesn't exist, create it and start at 0001

11. **Save Analysis File**
    - Filename format: `orchestrator/email-analysis/[NNNN]-[YYYY-MM-DD]-[sender-name].json`
    - Example: `orchestrator/email-analysis/0042-2025-11-09-john-smith.json`
    - Use kebab-case for sender name
    - Document the filename in JSON output's `artifacts.analysis_filename`

## Command JSON Output Requirements

Your command execution JSON output must include:

**Required Fields:**
- `command_type`: "analyze-email"
- `status`: "complete", "user_query", or "error"
- `session_summary`: Brief summary of email analysis
- `files.created`: Array with the analysis JSON file entry
- `artifacts.analysis_filename`: Path to the analysis JSON file
- `artifacts.email_data`: Copy of the email_metadata for quick reference
- `comments`: Array of notes about the analysis process

**For user_query status:**
- `queries_for_user`: Questions needing clarification (e.g., RAG credentials, project preferences)
- `context`: Save partial analysis and email content

**Example Comments:**
- "Email classified as professional with high confidence (0.95)"
- "Assigned to 'Website Redesign' project with 87% similarity"
- "Identified 3 action items with deadlines ranging from 2-5 days"
- "Draft response prepared; requires user input for meeting availability"
- "RAG database returned no strong matches; manual project assignment recommended"

## Tasks to Track

Create tasks in the internal todo list:

```
1.0 Parse and extract email content
2.0 Classify email importance and urgency
3.0 Query RAG database for project assignment
4.0 Extract tasks and deadlines
5.0 Generate draft response
6.0 Save structured JSON file
```

Mark tasks as completed as you progress.

## RAG Database Integration

### Expected RAG Query Format

The RAG database query should include:
- Email subject weighted highly
- Key phrases from body (2-3 most relevant)
- Entity names (people, projects, systems)
- Technical terms or domain keywords

### Expected RAG Response Format

```json
{
  "results": [
    {
      "project_id": "proj-123",
      "project_name": "Website Redesign",
      "similarity_score": 0.87,
      "matched_content": "snippet of matching project description",
      "metadata": {
        "last_updated": "datetime",
        "stakeholders": ["person1", "person2"]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### RAG Connection Handling

- If RAG database is unavailable: Set project_assignment.status to "rag_unavailable"
- If RAG credentials missing: Return status "user_query" requesting credentials
- If RAG query fails: Document error and set status to "unassigned"
- Include fallback to keyword matching if RAG fails

## Quality Checklist

Before marking complete, verify:
- ✅ Email metadata completely extracted and validated
- ✅ Classification includes confidence score and reasoning
- ✅ RAG database queried (or unavailability documented)
- ✅ All action items extracted with urgency and deadlines
- ✅ Deadlines converted to ISO 8601 format
- ✅ Draft response addresses all key points (if response needed)
- ✅ JSON file saved with correct naming and structure
- ✅ All required JSON schema fields populated
- ✅ Comments include insights about classification and matching
- ✅ Edge cases handled (no deadline, no project match, etc.)

## Error Handling

Handle these scenarios gracefully:

1. **Malformed Email**: Return error status with details
2. **RAG Unavailable**: Continue with limited project assignment
3. **No Clear Tasks**: Set tasks array to empty, note in comments
4. **Ambiguous Classification**: Use most likely category, lower confidence score
5. **No Response Needed**: Set draft_response.should_respond to false with explanation

## Privacy and Security Considerations

- Ensure sensitive information (passwords, SSNs, credentials) is not logged in comments
- Redact sensitive data in analysis file if present in email
- Document any sensitive content detected in analysis_metadata.requires_human_review
- Do not include full email body in command output JSON, only in analysis file
